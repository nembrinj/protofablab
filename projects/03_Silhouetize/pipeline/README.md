# Pipeline.json

This config file describes the various methods for an image editing pipeline.
<br>
Each method has different arguments like `kernel size`, `threshold`, `iterations`, etc. with some constraints. These
constraints are listed here along with a recommended value. This recommendation, however, depends on the image it is
being applied to. Therefore, user discretion is advised and the values only serve as a guide line.

## Structure

The overall structure is a list of methods and their descriptions:

```json
{
    "method 1": { ... },
    "method 2": { ... },
    ...
}
```

### Methods

Each method is either a direct function with arguments, or has different implementations which can be chosen.

A single method with arguments is described like the following:

```json
"method name": {
    "argument 1": {
        "constraint 1": ...,        // e.g. "min": 0
        "constraint 2": ...,        // e.g. "step": 2
        ...
        "recommended": ...,         // e.g. "recommended": 127
        "description": "..."        // can potentially be omitted
    },
    "argument 2": { ... },
    ...
    "description": "..."            // can potentially be omitted
}
```

For a method with different implementations, the description looks a bit more sophisticated:

```json
"method name": {
    "methods": ["f1", "f2", ...],
    "f1": { ... },                  // method description like above
    "f2": { ... },
    ...
    "recommended": ... ,            // e.g. "recommended" = "f1"
    "description": "..."            // can potentially be omitted
}
```

Some methods may not contain any parameters and only a short description.

### Constraints

The constraints typically define a (potentially unclosed) domain of values like

```json
"min": 0
"max": 255
```

Whereas the `step` key defines the step size in which to move inside this domain.

E.g., kernel sizes in `{3, 6, 9, ..., 15}` can be expressed like following:

```json
"kernel": {
    "min": 3,
    "max": 15,
    "step": 3
}
```

## Examples

See the [pipeline.json](pipeline.json).

# Calling the pipeline

Inside `pipeline.py` we provide all methods of the pipeline.
These methods take an image and a dictionary as arguments.

In order to go from a dict of pipeline arguments to the targeted methods, the global dict argument must have the
following form:

```json
{
    "img": ...,
    "pipeline": [
        "method 1": {
            "argument 1": ...,
            ...
        },
        "method 2": {
            "argument 1": ...,
            ...
        },
        ...
    ]
}
```

## Example

A full pipeline could look like this:

```json
{
    "img": ...,
    "pipeline": [
        "blur": {
            "method": "gaussian",
            "kernel": 7,
            "sigma": 0.75
        },
        "blur": {
            "method": "median",
            "kernel": 5
        },
        "threshold": {
            "method": "otsu"
        },
        "dilate": {
            "kernel": 7,
            "iterations": 3
        },
        "find_contours": {
            "method": "simple"
        },
        "smooth_contours": {
            "accuracy": 10
        },
        "clean_contours": {
            "threshold": 20
        }
    ]
}
```
