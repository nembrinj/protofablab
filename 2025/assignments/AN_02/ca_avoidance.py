## LIDAR INFORMATION 
# Contrary to simulation, real robot does not receive exactly 360 measures every scan (more or less around 270). Therefore it is necessary to know where it started its scan, the angle between two measures (provided by the robot /scan topic). We can use this information to convert that to 0 - 360 information in order to facilitate processing. The lambda function below helps doing that. In the end, the user receives two arrays of same lengths. The first array contains the angles and the second array contains the distances. (0 degree is ahead, 90 is left, 180 is behind and 270 is right)

# lambda function to convert rad to deg
RAD2DEG = lambda x: ((x)*180./math.pi)
