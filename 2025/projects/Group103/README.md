# Ball-E

## Abstract

## Introduction

- Introduce our idea by painting a picture (matching theatre style but obviously jsut in a few sentences)
- Motivate hope and dramturgy

- Summarize our contributions within the prototype

- List the content with links to the titles

## System Overview

- Concretize our idea:

    - Collect and throw LED, which is inside a ball
    - Automatically move towards LED

- Overview over connections: Component Schema

- Hardware List, sorted by adherence to part:
    
    - Ramp hardware
    - Blob detection hardware ...

## Design and Fabrication of Hard- and Software

- Present propulsion mechanism by going through the devlopment stage part by part:

    - First two tests (videos?)
    - LED-Ball
        - Use following schema to describe iterations
            - _Intial idea_: ...
            - _Iteration 1_:
                - **Considered Implementation:**  
                - **What Worked:**  
                - **What Didn't Work:**  
                - **Next Improvements:**  

    - Ramp
    - DC-Holders
    - Another test (ramp exit angle to flat)
    - Ramp-Extension
    - Funnel
    - Turtelbot3 connector

    - Circuit Arduino
        
        - 2 Schemas:
            - Visual + camera pic
            - logical, should be possible to export from same program as done viusal with
        - Parallel 
        - Relay
        - 2x battery-pack

- Automatic Movement
    - Blob-Detection
        - USB-Camera -> Setup
    - Python Movement Script

- Start up software

## Result
- Show demo video/link demo video
- Discussion of limitations and result in general?

## Discussion

- Change of initial idea
- Interpretation of results
- Lessons Learned

## Conclusion

- Summarize our project

## Future Works/Perfect Project
- What improvements would we make?
- How would the perfect implementation with a team of xx people and many resources be like.
