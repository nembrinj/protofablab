# Anyma Spots

Many thanks to Michael Egger for sharing the spots he developed and will use in the play.

The firmware provided is slightly adapted to a newer version of the ESP32 API see [link](https://forum.arduino.cc/t/ledcattachpin-ledcsetup-error-and-how-to-solve-it/1302164/6)

The board is an ESP32 C3 so you should be able choose any board that has this chip as base (I chose Adafruit QT Py ESP32 C3)

Do not forget to install the FastLED library.
